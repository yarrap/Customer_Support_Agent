# Customer_Support_Agent


In this repo we built a Customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. We used LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize the assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions.
